🚀 Just Built My First Project with Tailwind CSS!

I created a simple Streak Maintainer — a fun little web app that lets users track their daily progress toward a goal.

🖱️ When you click the "💪+" button, the current day gets stored in localStorage and added to a streak.

🔥 The streak is then shown right next to your goal, complete with a fire icon and the count of consecutive days — just like GitHub contributions!

This project may be small, but it taught me a lot about:

Using Tailwind CSS for clean, responsive UI

Creating glassmorphism effects using backdrop blur and transparent backgrounds

Managing local data with localStorage

Tracking and calculating consecutive streaks

💡 It’s also my first day using Tailwind CSS, and I already love how fast and flexible it is. Building a glassmorphism effect with it was surprisingly easy and fun.
